You will need the udev rules installed on your system. Copy `90-logitech.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and add your user to the `logitech` group, then run these commands:
```
udevadm control --reload-rules
udevadm trigger
```
and log out and back in, or alternatively just reboot.

You can build the tool with Cargo by navigating to the git clone directory and executing `cargo build --release`. The executable will now be in the `target/release` directory.

After building, try running `./target/release/g933-utils --help` to see an overview of the commands.
